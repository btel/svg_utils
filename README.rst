Python-based SVG editor
=======================

This is an utility package that helps to edit and concatenate SVG
files. It is especially directed at scientists preparing final figures
for submission to journal. So far it supports arbitrary placement and
scaling of svg figures and adding markers, such as labels.

See a `blog post <http://neuroscience.telenczuk.pl/?p=331>`_  for a short tutorial.
