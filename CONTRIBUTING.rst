## Code formatting

This project uses [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for automatically format the Python source code.
You can run the check and formatting hooks using pre-commit:

```
pip3 install pre-commit
pre-commit run --all
```

You can also integrate pre-commit with git, to run it for each commit:

```
pre-commit install
```
