Code of Conduct
===============

Like the technical community as a whole, the SVGutils team and community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they're participating within this community and project. These rules apply equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance.

This code of conduct applies to all communication: the issue tracker, comments, commits, and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by contacting any of our community leaders:

- **Bartosz Telenczuk**, `GitHub <https://github.com/btel>`_

New members may become community leaders with the support of at least two contributors, that created at least 2 pull requests in the period of last 2 years. This can be done by adding a pull request and any contributors supporting can comment on the issue.
Community leaders will review your complaint and decide on course of action following the incident.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical community.

- **Be friendly and patient**.
- **Be welcoming**. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- **Be considerate**. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you make will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
- **Be respectful**. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. 
- **Be careful in the words that you choose**. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for the community.
	- Violent threats or language directed against another person.
	- Discriminatory jokes and language.
	- Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
	- Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
	- Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
	- Unwelcome sexual attention.
	- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
	- Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
- **When we disagree, we try to understand why**. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and our community is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.
